# Benepik-project-Aws
Create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager: Log in to your AWS Management Console, navigate to Secrets Manager, and create a new secret.
Define the necessary keys (db_username, db_password, db_url) within the secret. You can either manually input these values or generate them programmatically.
Spring Boot Application:

Initialize a Spring Boot project: You can use Spring Initializr  to generate a new Spring Boot project with Maven/Gradle setup.
Configure the project to connect to a relational database: Use Spring Data JPA or Spring JDBC to connect to your preferred database (e.g., MySQL). Configure the data source to obtain credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.
Fetch and use credentials from AWS Secrets Manager during startup: Utilize the AWS SDK for Java within your Spring Boot application to interact with AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the credentials during application initialization.
Automatic Credential Update:

Implement a mechanism to automatically fetch the latest credentials: Use AWS SDK's functionality to periodically check for updates to the secret.
Seamless integration of updated credentials: Once new credentials are fetched, update the data source configuration dynamically to use the new credentials without requiring a restart. Spring Boot provides mechanisms for refreshing beans and configurations dynamically.
REST API Endpoint:

Create a simple REST API endpoint: Use Spring Web MVC to define REST controllers and endpoints.
Implement database operations using credentials from AWS Secrets Manager: Inject the data source bean configured with AWS Secrets Manager credentials into your repository/service classes and perform database operations within your API endpoint methods.
